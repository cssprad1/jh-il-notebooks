# IL Jupyter Example Notebooks

## Goal

The goal of these notebooks is to familiarize the user with Jupyter Hub and Notebooks. In addition, give examples of remote sensing/geospatial analysis work done with various tools on JupyterHub. 


## Conda Environment Setup

These notebooks use a variety of Python modules. The easiest way to do it is to create a Conda environment based on the .yml file in this directory.

`conda env create -f environment_droplet.yml`
